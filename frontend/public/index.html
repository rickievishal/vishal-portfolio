      content="Hi, I’m Vishal, a passionate Full-Stack Developer who loves turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly web experiences. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and enjoy crafting clean, responsive, and dynamic interfaces that users love to interact with.

I have hands-on experience building full-stack applications, creating immersive UI interactions, and deploying projects using Docker and VPS hosting. Beyond coding, I’m driven by UX design, smooth animations, and building applications that feel alive.

Whether it’s developing a web app from scratch, optimizing an existing project, or experimenting with new technologies, I’m always exploring ways to push the boundaries of web development.

Take a look at my work and see how I combine technical skills, creativity, and a love for polished experiences in every project I build."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
